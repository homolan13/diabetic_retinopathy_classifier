# Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy Detection

_Yanis Schärer, 21.08.2023_

This code archive is part of the master's thesis "Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy Detection with Multimodal Deep Learning" by Yanis Schärer, written at the ARTORG Center for Biomedical Engineering Research, University of Bern, Switzerland and supervised by Prof. Dr. Raphael Sznitman.

## Structure

The code is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the data used for training and testing the models. the images are stored in the subfolder `data/images/` and CSV-files for the various subsets are stored in `data/sets/`.
- `docs/`: Contains the documentation of the code.
- `source/`: Contains the source code of the project.
- `utils/`: Contains utility functions used by the source code.
- `misc/`: Contains miscellaneous files, that should help to run the code on a cluster.

## Requirements

The code was tested with the following software versions:

- Python 3.10.9
- NumPy 1.23.5
- Pandas 1.5.2
